As stated in the README file, most of the reverse engineering information required 
to operate the S20 was obtained from 

https://stikonas.eu/wordpress/2015/02/24/reverse-engineering-orvibo-s20-socket/

and 

http://pastebin.com/LfUhsbcS

While most of the information provided in these two sites is acurate, and it would be 
impossible to conclude this software without it, there are few catches and details 
that must be taken into account, namely incomplete information regarding socket time, 
slightly wrong information regarding time zones and DST, and the diference between 
regular countdown timers and the  "switch off upon switch on" timers. We address several 
of these points in the following. We assume that you are already familar with the basic 
structure of data communication with the sockets.

Most of the information  below resulted from combining the information in the two links
above with the  analysis of packet data using Wireshark. When referring byte  numbers 
within a packet, we assume that first byte is number 1.

1. Basic communication 
a) All communication between the client (here, we will designate broadly as 
"client" the device(s) that communicate with the sockets) are done by UDP packets 
sent to port 10000 in the socket.  
b) All msgs sent to the socket are a sequence of bytes with the following sequence
(represented in hexadecimal):

68 64 AA AA XX XX PP PP PP ...

Where

68 64 - Orvibo so-called "magic code", identifies the begining of all messages
AA AA - Packet length (including ALL bytes, namely the magic key), big  endian 
XX XX - Command / message code - identifies the action or command request
PP PP PP ... (variable size) - Payload

c) The socket replies to all messages received with a packet with a similar 
structure, with the same Command / message code, and the answer payload 
(which, in general, may have a different size):

68 64 BB BB XX XX RR RR RR ...

68 64 - Orvibo so-called "magic code", identifies the begining of all messages
BB BB - Reply packet length (including ALL bytes, namely the magic key), big  endian 
XX XX - Command / message code - identifies the action or command request, matches the 
sent command
RR RR RR ... (variable size) - Reply payload 

2. Socket time is available in UTC time in table 1, as reported in the "pastebin" 
data (in the following, we will referr as "pastebin" the reverse engineering data
published in http://pastebin.com/LfUhsbcS and reproduced as pastebin.pdf 
in the root directory of this distribution, thanks to Nozza87). 

However:
a) As discovered by Andrius Štikonas, UTC time is a timestamp in seconds, 
but considering the begining of time as 1 January 1900 instead of the more
conventional "Time since the epoch", starting in 1 Jan 1970.
You may obtain a conventional time stamp ("time since the epoch") subtracting 
from the socket time stamp 2208988800.
b) UTC time is reported in the first 4 bytes of the last 5 bytes of table 1 
(the very last byte of the table is the socket state, 01=ON, 00=OFF, so time
covers the four preceding bytes). Time is represented in little endian format.
This is slightly different from the information reported in pastebin.
Check the code in getSocketTime() in orvfms.php.
c) All weekly scheduled timers are represented in Hours Min and Seconds in local
time. More aboute these timers below.
d) Sockets take care of converting UTC time to local time taking into acount 
the local timezone (TZ) and Daylight Saving Time (DST).
e) It is possible to initialize the socket UTC time using a specific command.
While the WiWo performs this initialization, our code does not uses it, 
since the sockets  seem always to automatically synchronize by themselves 
using some NTP alike service.

However, for those interested in this possibility, initialization of the  
socket  clock in UTC can be done sending to the socket the following 
message:

0000  68 64 00 1a 63 73 MM MM MM MM MM MM 20 20 20 20   hd..cs..#5..    
0010  20 20 00 00 00 00 XX XX XX XX                     ........

where
68 64 - Magic Key
00 1a - Msg length
63 73 - Init socket clock command
20 ... 00 - Padding 
MM MM MM MM MM MM - Socket mac address
XX XX XX XX - Seconds since 1 Jan 1900 (in UTC), little endian.
 
The socket, as usualy, replies with a message with the same code 63 73 and with 
a dummy payload.

3. As reported in pastebin, timezone information is reported in table 4, byte 164.
However, the following details and additional info must be taken into account:
a) This byte is an integer offset in hours to GMT (positive values to the east, 
negative  values to the west). Negative values are represented in two's complemnent.
Therefore, TZ mid atlantic time in Azores (GMT -1) is FF.
b) Daylight savings time is represented in byte 161 of table 4 (in pastebin, this 
byte is identified as DHCP Mode. This is not correct).
c) DST active is represented by 00, DST off is represented by 01 (yes, it is 
inverted relative to  what would be the commons sense!).
d) While most TZs are integer, there are half time zones: Venezuela/Caracas, for 
example, is GMT -4.5 and Kabul GMT +4.5. It is awkward, but we found that these
"half time zones" are identified by the second least significant bit of byte 161
(yes, the same used for DST). Therefore, we have the following possible combinations 
for byte 161:
- 00: integer TZ, DST on
- 01: integer TZ, DST off
- 02: half TZ, DST on
- 03: half TZ, DST off

As a reference, one may consider the following examples:
- Azores (GMT-1), DST on:	byte 161 = 00, byte 164 = FF
- Caracas (GMT-4.5), DST off:   byte 161 = 03, byte 164 = FC
- Paris (GMT+1), DST off:       byte 161 = 01, byte 164 = 01
- Kabul (GMT+4.5), DST on:      byte 161 = 02, byte 164 = 04 

IMPORTANT NOTE: at the time of writing this document (12 Apr 2016), our tests seem 
to suggest  that the S20 socket do not support 15 minutes time zones (e.g., 
Kathmandu, GMT+5:45). While this timezone is in fact manually available in the WiWo, 
when it is selected (TZ=Kathmandu, DST off), byte 161 in table 4 appears as 03 and 
the socket seems in programmed as GMT+5:30 and not GMT+5:45. If there is 
anybody out  there on one of these "15m" time zones who has a S20 and is able to get
it properly synchronized, please drop me a note and I will try investigate further 
this issue.

4. The available information about the S20 "countdown timers" may be sometimes 
misleading. Each S20 supports in fact two types of "countdown timers".The first one
is the regular countdown  that decreases from a given initial value to zero, and 
performs a  pre-specified action (on or off) when reaches zero. A second timer 
may be better described as an "automatic switch off on a specified delay after switch on". 
If the "automatic switch off after switch on" is programmed with a given value, this value 
is copied to the regular countdown timer every time the socket is switched on, along 
with  an "off" action, and the regular countdown timer starts. The "automatic switch off
after switch on", when enabled, is constant, and therefore does not reset itself after
the switch on. By other words, when enabled, it will always trigger a countdown process 
after switch on, with a switch off ocurring when it reaches zero.

5. The "Automatic switch off after switch on timer" is the one reported in table 4. 
See more information on pastebin link above. 

When reading table 4, the following bytes are relevant.

byte 165: 00: automatic switch off timer disabled, 01 - timer enabled
bytes 167,168: timer value in seconds, represented in big endian format. 

The maximum value for the timer is 0xFFFF seconds, or 18.2 hours 
(notice that the WiWo interface sets a limit of 16:59:59 for the countdown 
timer)

6. To modify the "automatic switch off timer", the following strategy works:

a) Read table 4 according to the codes provided in http://pastebin.com/LfUhsbcS;
b) Update bytes 165, 167 and 168 with the new enabled status and countdown value;
c) Replace bytes 5 and 6 with the code for "write socket" msg: 74 6D
d) Delete bytes 19, 27 and 28 of the resulting message (basically, this is record
  information, not required);
e) Adjust bytes 3 and 4 with the new message size (basically, the received msg
   length less 3), in big endian format
f) Send to socket and wait reply.

7. Countdown timers
a) To check the regular countdown timer, its actual value during a countdown 
process, and the action to be performed when reaching zero, proceed as follows;

Send to socket, port 10000:

0000  68 64 00 1a 63 64 XX XX XX XX XX XX 20 20 20 20   hd..cd..#4..
0010  20 20 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00                       ........

where XX XX XX XX XX XX is the socket mac address, in big endian format. 68 64 is the 
magic key, 00 1a the msg length, 63 64 the msg code.

After sending the msg above to the socket, the following message is received:

0000  68 64 00 1a 63 64 XX XX XX XX XX XX 20 20 20 20   hd..cd..#4..
0010  20 20 00 00 00 00 00 AA BB BB                       .......)


byte 23 (AA) : 00-action = off, 01-action=on 
bytes 24 and 25 (BB BB): timer current value in seconds, LITTLE ENDIAN 


Therefore, if the message received is

0000  68 64 00 1a 63 64 XX XX XX XX XX XX 20 20 20 20   hd..cd..#4..
0010  20 20 00 00 00 00 00 00 0e 29                       .......)

this means that the count down timer is 290E seconds and the action to be performed is off.

b) To set the regular coutdown timer, the msg code that must be sent  to the socket
is almost the same as above but with byte 22  as 00 (instead of 01 for reading). As 
before AA and BB BB are the values to be set:

0000  68 64 00 1a 63 64 XX XX XX XX XX XX 20 20 20 20   
0010  20 20 00 00 00 00 00 AA BB BB                       

byte 23 (AA) : 00-action = off, 01-action=on 
bytes 24 and 25 (BB BB): timer current value in seconds, LITTLE ENDIAN 

8. Weekly scheduled timers are reported in table 3. Table 3 includes several records. 
Each record reports information aboute each one of the regular scheduled timers.
 
a) The first record starts in bytes 29,30 with the record length in LITTLE ENDIAN
format. The record length does not include the length bytes, only the record "payload".
After the first record, one may extract the following records until reaching the 
packet end (since the total packet length is well known).

b) Considering each full record, including the msg length bytes in positions 1 and 2, 
   each record format is as follows:
   - bytes 1,2  - Msg Lentgh
   - bytes 3,4  - Timer code. This is the unique 4 byte code that identifies
     	   	  the timer and which is required for delete and update operation. In
		  fact, in delete and update operation you specify this timer code,
		  not the record number. More on this below.
   - byte 21    - the action to be performed at the specified time (00, off, otherwise on)
   - byte 23,24 - year this timer was first set, LITTLE ENDIAN
   - byte 25    - month this timer was first set
   - byte 26    - day of the month this timer was first set
   - byte 27    - Scheduled hour
   - byte 28    - Scheduled minutes
   - byte 29    - Scheduled seconds
   - byte 30    - If >= 128, weekly repeat; otherwise just once.
     	  	Repeat rate: 128+XX, each bit in XX one day of the week:
     	  	XX = 64  - Sunday
		     32  - Saturday
		     16  - Friday
		      8  - Thursday
		      4  - Wednesday
		      2  - Tuesday
		      1  - Monday
 

c) Assume that a given record provides the following info:

   1C 00 FE 70 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
   20 20 20 20 01 00 DF 07 0A 1A 12 22 06 85

   1C 00 - Rec length, little endian
   FE 70 - Timer code
   (...) - Padding
   DF 07 - YYYY (little endian)
   0A    - MM (month)
   1A    - DD
   12    - HH	
   22    - MM (minutes)
   06    - SS
   85    - Weekly repeat code 0 0x85 = 133 = 128 + 4 + 1 => 4 + 1 => Wednesday, Monday  

In order to update this timer, send the following msg to the socket:

0000  68 64 00 37 74 6d XX XX XX XX XX XX 20 20 20 20   hd.7tm..#4..    
0010  20 20 00 00 00 00 03 00 01 1c 00 fe 70 20 20 20     ..........p   
0020  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 00 df                ...
0030  07 0a 1a 12 22 06 85                              ...."..

Where:

	68 64 - Magic key
	00 37 - Msg Length
	74 6D - Update code
	XX XX XX XX XX XX - mac address
	20 20 20 20 20 20 00 00 00 00 - usual padding
	03 00 01 1C 00 - Update timer code
	FE 70 - Timer code
	16 (sixteen) x 20 - padding
	DF 07 - YY Little endian
	0A    - MM (month)
	1A    - DD
	12    - HH	
   	22    - MM (minutes)
   	06    - SS
   	85    - Weekly repeat code 

d) Add a new timer: quite similar, but the  updated timer code must be replaced
   with the sequence  "03 00 00 1c 00". The timer code, in this case, must be a 
   unique 4 hexadecimal code that is not yet used by other timer. We do not 
   know which algorithm or sequence Orvibo adopts to generate the timer code. 
   We just use a random generated code and we check if it is unique. This 
   strategy works fine. 

Packet to send:

0000  68 64 00 37 74 6d XX XX XX XX XX XX 20 20 20 20   hd.7tm..#4..    
0010  20 20 00 00 00 00 03 00 00 1c 00 cc 2e 20 20 20     ...........   
0020  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 01 00 df                ...
0030  07 0a 1a 05 08 03 ff                              .......

	XX XX XX XX XX XX - mac address

e) To delete timer with code 4f 37, send:

0010  20 20 00 00 00 00 03 00 02 4f 37                    .......O7

        68 64 - Magic key
	00 1b - Packet length
	74 6D - Message code
	XX XX XX XX XX XX - mac address
	6x20+4x00 - Usual padding
	03 00 02 - delete code
